//! Per-ecosystem hook shim installation: merges a WaddleAI hook entry into
//! an editor/agent's own JSON config file, and — on uninstall — restores
//! that file to its exact pre-install bytes.
//!
//! # Why byte-for-byte restore, not JSON-diff removal
//!
//! `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`, and VS Code's
//! `settings.json` are user-owned files that certainly carry unrelated
//! content already — other hooks, editor preferences, extension settings.
//! The safest uninstall this crate can offer is not "parse the file again
//! and delete our entry" (which re-serializes the *whole* file through
//! `serde_json` and so can reformat or reorder content this crate never
//! touched) but "put back the exact bytes that were there before install
//! ever touched the file" — [`backup::snapshot`] records those bytes (or
//! "the file did not exist") before the first write, and [`uninstall`]
//! replays them verbatim. See [`backup`]'s doc for the on-disk format.
//!
//! Every write goes through [`fsutil::write_atomic`] (or, for uninstall's
//! restore, the same primitive used indirectly via [`std::fs::write`] only
//! after the atomic rename path fails to apply — see [`uninstall`]): a temp
//! file in the same directory, then a rename, so a reader (the editor, the
//! agent process) never observes a half-written config.
